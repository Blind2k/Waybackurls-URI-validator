# Waybackurls-URI-validator

# This is a complimentary Bash/Shell/zsh script to filter all of the URLs returned from the awysome "waybackurls" tool
-- https://github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls/tree/master

# This script will:
-- Sort and orgnize the original list from waybackurls
-- Check if the returned URLs still active
-- Completly passive using waybackMachine

If you need any thing, please contact me.

# TODO
-- Get mad on this script one day for being too slow. Than I will have to convert this to multithread processing to check if URLs available at a higher rate.
